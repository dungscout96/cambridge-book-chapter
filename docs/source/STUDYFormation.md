# Organize your EEGLAB datasets to STUDY
## Creating a STUDY

This part of the tutorial will demonstrate how to create an EEGLAB
STUDY and perform simple plotting. 
An EEGLAB STUDY (or study) contains descriptions of and links to data
contained in many epoched or continuous datasets, for example, a set of
datasets from a group of subjects in one or more conditions of the
same task or performing different tasks in the same or different
sessions. We use a *STUDY* to manage and process data recorded from multiple subjects, sessions, and/or conditions of an experimental study. 

In addition to the tutorial sections below, you may want to watch the short video below on multiple subjects processing in EEGLAB (hosted on Youtube):

## Getting ready for group-level analysis

### Description of the 5-subject experiment tutorial data

In this tutorial, we will use a [5-subject STUDY](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/STUDY5subjects.zip) (450Mb). These data were acquired by Peter Ullsberger and colleagues from five subjects
performing an auditory task in which they were asked to distinguish
between synonymous and non-synonymous word pairs (the second word
presented 1 second after the first). 

Data epochs were extracted from 2
sec before the second-word onset to 2 sec after the second-word onset.

After decomposing each subject's data by ICA, two EEG datasets were
extracted, one (Synonyms) comprising trials in which the second word was
synonymous with the first one, and one (Non-synonyms) in which the
second-word was not a synonym of the first. 

Thus the study includes 10
datasets, two condition datasets for each of five subjects. Since both
datasets of each subject were recorded in a single session, the
decompositions and resulting independent component maps are the same
across both conditions for each subject.

After downloading the sample STUDY data, unzip it in a folder of your
choice (preferably in the 'sample_data' sub-folder of the EEGLAB release
you are currently using). This will
create a sub-folder *STUDY5subjects*. Then open
a MATLAB session and run *\>\> eeglab*.

In other EEGLAB *STUDY* tutorials, we will also use the [STERN task data](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/STUDYstern_125hz.zip) (0.9Gb) and  the [animal/non-animal categorization task data](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/animal_study.zip) (0.4Gb).

### Data organization

The term *STUDY* indicates that datasets
should originate from a single experimental STUDY and have comparable
structure and significance. 

The tutorial data is already optimally organized. However, when creating
a new STUDY, it is preferable to organize your data before running the
STUDY functions. 

We suggest creating one directory or folder per
subject, then storing the EEG dataset (".set") files for that subject in
this folder. Even better, use the [BIDS EEGLAB plugin](https://github.com/sccn/bids-matlab-tools/wiki) to organize your data and make it BIDS compliant. The STUDY functions will then automatically add measure
files to the same subject directories.

### EEGLAB memory settings

We also advise modifying the default EEGLAB memory options. Call menu item <span style="color: brown">File → Preferences</span>. 
The first option determines if more than one dataset may be stored in memory. We will be selecting this option when performing group analysis, as it is often not possible to hold all datasets in memory.

![Image:preferences.png](/assets/images/preferences.png)

When in use, *STUDY* datasets are
partially or totally loaded into EEGLAB. They thus may also be
accessed and modified individually, when desired, through the main
EEGLAB graphic interface or using EEGLAB functions within
custom dataset processing scripts. Dataset data arrays are then read from disk whenever
EEGLAB requires access to the data, but without cluttering memory. This
will allow MATLAB to load and hold a large number of dataset structures (2,300 is the all-time record), forming a large STUDY. 

## Quick STUDY creation
After uncompressing the [5-subject tutorial data](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/STUDY5subjects.zip), select the
 <span style="color: brown">File → Create study → Simple ERP STUDY</span> menu item to create a *STUDY*. The interface below pops up. Enter two for the number of conditions and five for the number of subjects, then press *Ok*.

![](/assets/images/simplestudy1.png)

Then enter the following information in the interface below. There are two columns of data files, one for the condition *synonym* (files *synXX-s253-clean.set) and one for the condition *non-synonym* (files *synXX-s254-clean.set*) with one row per subject. You may use the browse ("...") button to select the files. Name the *STUDY* "N400" and press *Ok*.

![](/assets/images/simplestudy3.png)

The following interfaces pop up. One is the grand average ERP across conditions for all electrodes. You may click on a trace to pop up a new figure. The other interface is the *STUDY* plotting graphic GUI. This interface is described in detail in the [STUDY visualization tutorial](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/study_data_visualization_tools.html).

![](/assets/images/simplestudy2.png)

This is how simple it is to create a *STUDY*. In the rest of this tutorial page, we will describe an alternative method for *STUDY* creation. This other method is more involved but allows setting additional parameters.

## Creating a new STUDY
To create a *STUDY*, select the
 <span style="color: brown">File → Create study → Browse for datasets</span> menu item.

Another option is to load into
EEGLAB all the datasets you want to include in the study and select
the 
<span style="color: brown">File → Create study → Using all loaded datasets</span> menu item. 
A blank interface similar to the one described below
will appear. In this window, enter a name for the *STUDY*
('N400'), and a short description of the study ('Auditory task:
Synonyms Vs. Non-synonyms, N400'). 

Here, we do not add notes about the
study, but we recommend that you do so for your own studies. The
accumulated notes will always be loaded with the study, easing later
analyses, and re-analyses. Note that here the fields *Subject* and *Condition* (above) have been filled
automatically. This is because the datasets already contained this
information. For instance, if you were to load this dataset into
EEGLAB by selecting the <span style="color: brown">Edit → Dataset info</span> menu item, you would be able to edit the *subject*, *condition*, *group*, *session*, and *run* for this dataset. You may also edit this information within the study itself. The dataset information and study dataset information may be different to ensure maximum flexibility, although we recommend checking the checkbox *Update dataset info...* to keep them consistent.

Click on the *Browse* button in the first blank location and select a dataset name. Do so for other datasets as well. 

The interface window should then look like the following:

![](/assets/images/studycreate.png)

Below, we detail what the *STUDY* terms *subject*, *session*, *run*, *condition*, and *group* mean.

- The top of the window contains information about the STUDY, namely its
running name, the extended task name for the STUDY, and some notes.
- The next section contains information about the 10 datasets that are
part of the STUDY. For each dataset, we have specified a subject code
and condition name. 
- For each file, you may assign a session and run number. A run is when there are blocks in an experiment, and the data from each block is stored in a separate file. Sessions are used when the data is collected on different days or when there is a break that involves removing the EEG cap. We chose to leave the session and run empty since there are irrelevant for this *STUDY* (there is only one session and one run per subject).
- The *condition* column contains the condition associated with each file. Note that we have two files here per subject. However, it is also possible to have a single file per subject and to define conditions using EEGLAB event trial types. For more information on this topic, read the [STUDY design tutorial](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/working_with_study_designs.html).
- The *group* column indicates the group a subject belongs to. This is irrelevant for this STUDY since there
was only one subject group.
- We will come back later to the *Select by r.v.* (select ICA component by residual variance) and the *Comp...* button when we perform ICA component clustering.
- Pressing the *Clear* button clears the information on a given row.

In general, we prefer the dataset information to be consistent with
the *STUDY* information -- thus, we may check the first checkbox. The second checkbox removes all current cluster information and will be explained when we perform ICA component clustering.

After you have finished adding datasets to the study, press *Ok* in the [pop_study.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_study.m) GUI to import all the datasets.

We strongly recommend that you also save the *STUDY* by selecting the EEGLAB
menu item <span style="color: brown">File → Save study as</span> after closing the [pop_study.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_study.m) window.

## Loading an existing STUDY
Either use the studyset created in the previous section or load
another studyset. To load a studyset, select the <span style="color: brown">File → Load existing study</span> menu item. Select the file
*N400.study* in the folder *STUDY5subjects*. After loading or creating a
study, the main EEGLAB interface should look like this:

![Study Window](/assets/images/guistudy.png)

In the EEGLAB GUI (above): 
- *Epoch consistency* indicates whether or
not the data epochs in all the datasets have the same lengths and
limits.
- *Channels per frame* indicates the number of channels in each
of the datasets (*It is possible to process datasets with different
numbers of channels*).
- *Channel location* indicates whether or not
channel locations are present for all datasets. 
- *Clusters*  indicates the number of component clusters associated
with this STUDY. There is always at least one cluster associated with
a STUDY. This contains all the pre-selected ICA components from all
datasets.
- *Status* indicates the current status of the
STUDY. In the case above, this line indicates that the STUDY is ready
for pre-clustering. 

To list the datasets in the STUDY, use the
<span style="color: brown">Study → Edit study info</span> menu item. The interface described in the previous section will pop up.

## Editing STUDY datasets
Selecting an individual dataset from the
<span style="color: brown">Datasets</span> menu item allows editing individual
datasets in a *STUDY*. 

Note, however, that creating new datasets or
removing datasets will also remove the *STUDY* from memory since the
study must remain consistent with datasets loaded in memory (EEGLAB will prompt you to save the *STUDY* before it is deleted).
